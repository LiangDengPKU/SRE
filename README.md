# SRE
Implementing Scale Rate Encoding in Darknet & Swin transformer.  

Dataset: Construct a synthetic dataset tailored to specific pathology applications. The dataset should simulate relevant medical imaging conditions to effectively train and evaluate the model.

Original Dataset: The original dataset is not applicable, necessitating the creation of a synthetic alternative.

Pretrained Weights for Backbone: 

  1. Official Darknet GitHub Repository:
  Visit the Darknet GitHub page. Look for links to pretrained weights in the README file.

  2. YOLO Weights Download Page:
  Access the YOLO Weights Page for various versions of YOLO, which utilize Darknet.

  3.Official Swin transformer GitHub Repository:
    Visit the Swin transformer GitHub page. Look for links to pretrained weights in the README file.

  4. Baidu Netdisk:
