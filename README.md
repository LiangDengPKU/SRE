Implementing Scale Rate Encoding in Darknet

Dataset: Construct a synthetic dataset tailored to specific pathology applications. The dataset should simulate relevant medical imaging conditions to effectively train and evaluate the model.

Original Dataset: The original dataset is not applicable, necessitating the creation of a synthetic alternative.

Pretrained Weights for Darknet Backbone: You can download pretrained weights for Darknet backbones from the following sources:

  1. Official Darknet GitHub Repository:
  Visit the Darknet GitHub page. Look for links to pretrained weights in the README file.

  2. YOLO Weights Download Page:
  Access the YOLO Weights Page for various versions of YOLO, which utilize Darknet.

  3. Run train_resnet_gmp.py to benchmark the ResNet/DenseNet architecture enhanced with Global Maximum Pooling.     
     resnet152 + GMP: network_res_max.py.
     densenet161 + GMP: denseNet_max.py.
